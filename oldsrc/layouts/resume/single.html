                            My craft is developing infrastructure that automates 
                            tasks so that people can do more and do it faster.
                            I'm pragmatic about my technology choices; while I 
                            write in Python now I used to be a Rubyist. If I need to
                            build a delivery pipeline I know I can use whatever tool is 
                            required because the mechanics of continuous integration, 
                            deliver, and deployment are not locked to just one tool.
                            Methodologies are the same way: whether the team works 
                            in a scrum, kanban, waterfall, scrumfall, or scrumban 
                            mode, I'm able to adapt to the needs of the organization.

                            creating a Ruby Gem CLI tool that abstracted our

                            we leveraged S3 and CloudFront to reduce the pain of
                            running a NodeJS web app in an elastic fashion. I also
                            introduced Vagrant and Packer to our team and created a

                            My first career after the military took me right back
                            to Baghdad. After almost two years in Iraq during my
                            military career I had intimate knowledge about the ways
                            Intelligence was collected in theater and worked with
                            the theater command to find better ways to dissemenate
                            intelligence to the divisions in charge of peace-keeping
                            operations. The most important aspect of my job was
                            working with other intelligence organizations to fuse
                            and share intelligence from disparate sources into a
                            cohesive picture of what was happening in real time.

                            I spent almost six years in the US Army, starting as a
                            PV2 and ending my career as a Sergeant. My primary
                            MOS was 96B: All Source Intelligence Analyst. This
                            particular job is difficult because an All Source
                            Analyst has to be able to understand disparate
                            intelligence sources (sensors, first hand accounts,
                            imagery) and fuse it together in order to create a
                            mental model of what's going on at any one time on the
                            battlefield. In Kosovo and Iraq I was challenged with a
                            much different task: assymetric warfare and peacekeeping.
                            In this capacity I acted more like a detective, tracking
                            the activities of criminal and terrorist organizations
                            as they vied for influence.
