# My Personal Website

This is the repo for my personal website, [richardboydii.com](richardboydii.com). This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator written in [Go](https://golang.org). 

# How It's Made

One of the most frustrating things about coming to web design as a tertiary skill is that it can be extremely frustrating to put something together that not just works but also _looks good_. 

## Tools
![My Laptop](https://github.com/richardboydii/richardboydii.com/blob/ver2/src/static/img/x260.JPG)

This website is entirely built on my "personal" laptop, an IBM ThinkPad X260 that I purchased used off of Ebay. I'm currently running Ubuntu 20 and _everything just works_. 

## Setup Instructions

1. Fork the repo.
2. Run git submodule update --init --recursive to pull down the [smol theme](https://github.com/colorchestra/smol).
3. Then run hugo serve to serve the page.
