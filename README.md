This is a repo for my personal website 
[richardboydii.com](https://richardboydii.com). The website uses the
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static website engine and the 
[Goa](https://github.com/shenoybr/hugo-goa) theme. 

If you're new to using Hugo, feel free to peruse the repo to see how I've used 
overrides inlayouts to generate static content and alter the site from the 
original theme.

The site is hosted using S3, CloudFront, and an SSL cert generated with the 
AWS Certificate Manager.
