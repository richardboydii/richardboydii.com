This is a repo for my personal website
[richardboydii.com](https://richardboydii.com). The website uses the
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static website engine by and the
[Sustain](https://github.com/nurlansu/hugo-sustain) theme. If you're new to
using Hugo, feel free to peruse the repo to see how I've used overrides in
layouts to generate static content and alter the site from the original theme.
