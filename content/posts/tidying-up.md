I haven't blogged nearly as much as I had planned on blogging. This past year has been a pretty busy year. I attended the DevOpsDays Organizer Summit and presented on how to do a venue search (something near and dear to my heart). I also presented at DevOpsDays Philadelphia (still wishing that I had taken ane extra day to explore the city). I was lucky enough to attend Kubecon North America this year and have decided to go after my Certified Kubernetes Administrator Certification.

Going into the new year, I want to try and blog at least once a week and increase my BlueSky and LinkedIn posts as well. I've never made a concerted effort to grow my social media following, but I really need to, especially if I want to make it as a speaker at more conferences.
