Over the course of my life I've always gravitated towards technology. Though my job title has changed over the years I'm still doing what I've always done: building systems. At 15 those systems were custom-built computers that I built in the back of a Radio Shack. Today they are complex, ephemeral system of systems that use cloud technologies and custom software. To me, they're all Lego pieces and I enjoy coming up with new ways to fit all the blocks together.

Besides my professional life, I'm an organizer for DevOpsDays Austin, one of the best DevOps conferences held anywhere. Each year we open our doors to developers and operators from around the world and host them at a one of a kind venue: Texas Memorial Stadium. Giving back to the DevOps community means a lot to me because I've been able to get so much out of it. And, it turns out, organizing can be really fun.

When I'm not at work or organizing, I'm spending time with my amazing wife and super-rad daughter. We like to explore all the cool things that happen around Austin and hike around all the green spaces. When I can, I like to stop by the local breweries to see what they've concocted and take in a movie at the Alamo Drafthouse.
